# POSReady
A command line based Point-Of-Sale System

Has multiple features including printing to a reciept printer.

Dependencies: JLine (Should remove, but one import is there)
              Apache Commons IO
              Jython (If you're running this on a regular terminal, you're going to be fine.)
              
Enjoy!
